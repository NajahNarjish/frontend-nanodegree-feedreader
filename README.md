## Introduction

This is a Frontend-nanodegree-feedreader project that I've done as part of my Nanodegree program in Udacity. The project is made by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. All the files  were provided by Udacity and I have updated the feedreader.js file only. I added codes to test the functionality of the page. All these tests are done by using Jasmine framework.


## How to run

Just clone the project and open the index.html file on a browser. 


## Tests
In the Jasmine framework, we can see at bottom of the page, we have some tests passed. These tests are for checking some of the functionalities of the codes if they are working correctly or not.
